# single-neuron-dynamics-simulation
This project simulates the dynamics of a single neuron based on the Nagumo model, utilizing Python to analyze action potentials through differential equations. It includes visualizations, parameter tuning using empirical electrophysiological data, and the application of optimization techniques for improved simulation accuracy.
